# WaveDetector
this project implemented using ATmega16 target to take input signal on ADC channel and determine signal shape( DC, sin, square(pwm), triangle, saw), frequency, amplitude, duty cycle using ADC, Timer, ICU, AnalogComparator, DIO, interrupts

#version1 8/8/2020
not all driver are fully implemented  like ADC, Analog Comparator 
LCD, DIO not written by me 
there's more efficient version from ExtInterrupt driver compined with Dio written by me in (AVR driver Repo)
